# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

This is the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project. The R script run_analysis.R does the following:

- Merges the training and test data sets
- Extracts measurements (mean,std) from the observations
- Use descriptive names and appropriate labels for the activity names
- Creates a tidy data set from the manipulations.
